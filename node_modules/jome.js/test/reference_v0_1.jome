## Calculating sheet

Using jome as a helper calculating sheet.

### Example: Calculating torque
###

let distance = <nb>1m</nb>
let force = <nb>10N</nb>

###
The torque is the result of a force multiplied by a distance. The result is:
###

let result = <nb>{force*distance}</nb>

###
FIXME: result should be a computed output, not a data input.

I don't know yet how I want to handle that

You can use regular js comments with `//` and `/* */`.

You can also use `# ` for documentation comments. Note: The hashtag must be followed by a space.
